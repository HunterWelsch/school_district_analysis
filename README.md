# Analysis Questions 
1. After removing the selected data from the data set the percentage of students passing each subject slightly declined (no change greater than 1.5%). As well as a slight decline in the average reading and math scores.
2. The removal of the selected data affected only Thomas High School in the school summary.
3. After removing the 9th grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School the performance of the school barely changed. The average reading and math score at Thomas High changed less than one percent when the 9th grade reading and math scores were removed. The number of students who passed reading and math at Thomas High each decreased by 28%. 
4. Math and reading scores cross-referenced with any other variable will be affected. Thomas High School will rank significantly lower than it does with the 9th grade scores in the analysis. In turn other schools scores will look as if they are inflated.
